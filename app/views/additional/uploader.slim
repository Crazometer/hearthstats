	| Why enter your matches manually when you can let our uploader take care of everything for you? &nbsp;
	| This open source utility uses screen capture analysis of your Hearthstone window. It does not do packet sniffing, &nbsp;
	| monitoring, or network modification of any kind. The project is and always will be open source so that you &nbsp;
	| can do your own builds and see exactly what's happening within the program.
